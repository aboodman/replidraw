- file a bug about sync and init setup
- file a bug about schema validating mutations
- make connect fire a poke / double as pull
- fix databaseSetup
- figure out backoff some other way
- make use of docID/documentID/roomID consistent! (let's use room)
- the batched transactions in push don't discard state!
  - fix clientid at same time


x remove pushRes and pull from protocol and server impl
x remove animation and try it
x move replidraw to heroku
x move replidraw to zod
====
x move replidraw to a socket
====
x bring the Replicache.poke() pr back to life
x test computePoke
x test push
- test pull
- test connect
x manual test server using postman
- maybe fix up stats printing in push
- integrate!
====
- add timing to poke without queuing/loop
- add loop


bonus
- what would be really cool is if the mutators validated their inputs using zod too!
- not sure how to do this
- if ts-to-zod worked it would be ideal!
